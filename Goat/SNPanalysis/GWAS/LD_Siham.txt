# Siham LD:
We pruned for Linkage Disequilibrium using the combined dataset 
containing all 4 breeds. Pruning parameters used around each SNP, 
window size +/- 1 Mb around the SNP, LD between markers was 
defined as R2 > 0.5, and in each LD block, we keep the marker 
with the highest MAF

This resulted in the removal of 1523 markers in LD, reducing the 
total number of markers from 48505 to 46982

We redid the PCA analysis on the LD pruned data, and now discover 61 
compared to 49 SNPs above the threshold (0.02). All SNPs previously 
identified are still in the 61 SNPs identified using the LD pruned data.
The additional 12 SNPs have become significant due to the reduced 
number of markers, which has increased the contribution of each SNPs 
(since previously 48505 markers add up to 100 %, after LD pruning 
46982 markers add up to 100%). However we observe that markers with 
high contribution tend to benefit more from this increased contribution.
